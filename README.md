## What is HTML?

`HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web. HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, <p>, <div>, <span>, <img>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <video>, <ul>, <ol>, <li> and many others.`

## History of HTML and who is behind it?

HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not released officially, which was published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version of HTML.

HTML is a very evolving markup language and has evolved with various versions updating. Long before its revised standards and specifications are carried in, each version has allowed its user to create web pages in the much easier and prettier way and make sites very efficient.

- **HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information which can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not much of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.**

- **Then comes the HTML 2.0, published in 1995; which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with that few additional features; which remained as the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.**
- **Then comes the HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett who introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.**
- **Then comes the HTML 4.01 which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which is currently released and used worldwide. HTML 5 can be said for as an extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in the year 2012.**

## How does the browser render HTML?

we need to understand what DOM is. When a browser sends a request to the server to fetch an HTML document, the server returns an HTML page in binary stream format which is basically a text file with a response header Content-Type which has value text/html; charset=UTF-8. Here text/html is a MIME Type which tells the browser that it is an HTML document and charset=UTF-8 tells the browser that it is encoded in UTF-8 character encoding. Using this information, the browser can convert the binary format into a readable text file. This has shown below in the screenshot.

## What is CSS?

- External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

## History of CSS

CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. ... Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.
