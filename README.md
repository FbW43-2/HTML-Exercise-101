- ### What is the history of HTML and who is behind HTML?

```
HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991 but was not released officially, which was published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version of HTML.


1. HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information which can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not much of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.

2. HTML 2.0, published in 1995; which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with that few additional features; which remained as the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.

3. HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett who introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.

4. HTML 4.01 which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which is currently released and used worldwide.

5. HTML 5 can be said for as an extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in the year 2012.

- ### What are Markup languages and types on markup languages

```
A markup language is a human-readable language that is used by a computer to annotate an electronic document so that the computer can better understand the style and structure of the document.

An electronic markup language uses tags to define different elements throughout a document. All humans must be able to read markup languages, and so they mostly rely on real intelligible words instead of the unintelligible syntax used in programming.

HTML – Hypertext Markup Language
KML – Key whole Markup Language
MathML – Mathematical Markup Language
SGML – Standard Generalized Markup Language
XHTML – eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language
XML – eXtensible Markup Language

In web design and development, the three most-used markup languages are HTML, XML, and XHTML.
```

- ### How does the browser render HTML?

```
Rendering Engine is responsible for rendering a specific web page requested by the user on their screen. It interprets HTML and XML documents along with images that are styled or formatted using CSS, and a final layout is generated, which is displayed on the user interface.
```

- ### What is CSS?

```
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets

CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media

CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once

External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
```

- ### What is the history of CSS?

```
The birth of CSS is largely credited to Norwegian Håkon Wium Lie, who back in 1994 sought to create a universal standardised style sheet for the World Wide Web.

The first site that Lie trialled CSS on was the Arena web browser. From its first creation, Lie went on to co-create CSS1, CSS2 and RFC 2318 versions with Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau. In its first decade of existence (1994 – 2004) CSS, in all its specifications, became an established web standard greatly influencing the look and accessibility of the world wide web as we know it today. CSS3 was issued in 1999.
```

- ### Why is CSS important?

```
CSS separates a page's content and structure from it's design and formatting. This allows designers and website owners to quickly apply formatting to their layouts, and make any necessary changes and tweaks.

With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
