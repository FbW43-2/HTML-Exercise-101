## HTML

> - HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
>   HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages HTML . It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications.

## The History of HTML

- HTML was created by **Sir Tim Berners-Lee** in late 1991 but was not released officially, which was published in 1995 as HTML 2.0. HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999 and was a major version of HTML.

- HTML 1.0 was released in 1993 with the intention of sharing information which can be readable and accessible via web browsers. But not much of the developers were involved in creating websites. So the language was also not growing.
- Then comes the HTML 2.0, published in 1995; which contains all the features of HTML 1.0 along with that few additional features; which remained as the standard markup language for designing and creating websites until January 1997 and refined various core features of HTML.
- Then comes the HTML 3.0, where Dave Raggett who introduced a fresh paper or draft on HTML. It included improved new features of HTML, giving more powerful characteristics for webmasters in designing web pages. But these powerful features of new HTML slowed down the browser in applying further improvements.
- Then comes the HTML 4.01 which is widely used and was a successful version of HTML before HTML 5.0, which is currently released and used worldwide. HTML 5 can be said for as an extended version of HTML 4.01 which was published in the year 2012

## Markup languages and types on markup languages

> a markup language is a language that annotates text so that the computer can manipulate that text. Most markup languages are human-readable because the annotations are written in a way to distinguish them from the text itself.
> for example:

- HTML – Hypertext Markup Language
- KML – Keyhole Markup Language
- MathML – Mathematical Markup Language
- SGML – Standard Generalized Markup Language
- XHTML – eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language
- XML – eXtensible Markup Language

## How does the browser render HTML?

When a web page is loaded, the browser first reads the TEXT HTML and constructs DOM Tree from it. Then it processes the CSS whether that is inline, embedded or external CSS and constructs the CSSOM Tree from it. After these trees are constructed, then it constructs the Render-Tree from it. Once the Render-Tree is constructed, then the browser starts the printing individual elements on the screen.

## CSS

> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
>
> - CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
> - CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
> - External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

## history of CSS

CSS was first proposed by **Håkon Wium Lie** on October 10, 1994. At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.
The first site that Lie trialled CSS on was the Arena web browser. From its first creation, Lie went on to co-create CSS1, CSS2 and RFC 2318 versions with Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau. In its first decade of existence (1994 – 2004) CSS, in all its specifications, became an established web standard greatly influencing the look and accessibility of the world wide web as we know it today. CSS3 was issued in 1999.

## Why CSS important?

CSS is important because it allows web designers, developer, bloggers, and so forth to make our websites unique and attractive. ... CSS allows us to separate the presentation from the structure (HTML) into different files.
