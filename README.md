1. What is HTML?
   --The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.

- What is the history of HTML and who is behind HTML?
  The original HTTP proposal by Tim Berners-Lee was designed with simplicity in mind as to help with the adoption of his other nascent idea: the World Wide Web. The strategy appears to have worked: aspiring protocol designers, take note.

In 1991, Berners-Lee outlined the motivation for the new protocol and listed several high-level design goals: file transfer functionality, ability to request an index search of a hypertext archive, format negotiation, and an ability to refer the client to another server. To prove the theory in action, a simple prototype was built, which implemented a small subset of the proposed functionality:

- What are Markup languages and types on markup languages
  A markup language is a computer language that uses tags to define elements within a document. It is human-readable, meaning markup files contain standard words, rather than typical programming syntax. While several markup languages exist, the two most popular are HTML and XML.

1. HTML – Hypertext Markup Language
2. KML – Keyhole Markup Language
3. MathML – Mathematical Markup Language
4. SGML – Standard Generalized Markup Language
5. XHTML – eXtensible Hypertext Markup Language
   6, XML – eXtensible Markup Language

- How does the browser render HTML?
  Screen: Mostly, screens refresh 60 times per second(Refresh rate). the browser needs to match the device’s refresh rate and put up 1 new picture, or frame, for each of those screen refreshes the browser has limited time 16.66 ms. the browser has a lot of work to do not just render images, so all your work to display frame needs to be done in 10ms.

3. What is CSS?
   --CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media),
   ---CSS comes through and specifies your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS. Think of HTML as the foundation (every house has one), and CSS as the aesthetic choices (there’s a big difference between a Victorian mansion and a mid-century modern home).

- What is the history of CSS?
  --CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994.[22] At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.[23] Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)[24] being released in 1996. In particular, a proposal by Bert Bos was influential; he became co-author of CSS1, and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.[25]

- Why CSS important

CSS is important because it allows web designers, developer, bloggers, and so forth to make our websites unique and attractive. CSS gives us the opportunity to play with a page layout, adjust colors and fonts, add effects to images, etc.

4. Show an example of all versions of HTML(Basic structure) in your index.html file.
