    <h1>HTML Versions</h1>
    <h3>HTML 1.0</h3>
    <p>
      The original version of HTML was HTML 1.0. It had very limited features
      which greatly limited what you could do in designing your web pages.
    </p>

    <h3>HTML 2.0</h3>
    <p>
      HTML 2.0 then arrived and included all the features of HTML 1.0 plus
      several new features for web page design. Until January, 1997, HTML 2.0
      was the standard in web page design.
    </p>

    <h3>HTML 3.2</h3>
    <p>
      It was developed in 1997. After HTML 2.0 was developed, the next version
      of HTML was 3.2 With version 3.2 of HTML, HTML tags were further improved.
      It is worth noting that because of W3C standard maintenance, the newer
      version of HTML was 3.2 instead of 3.
    </p>

    <h3>HTML 4.0</h3>
    <p>
      It was developed in 1999 It extended the support of cascading styling
      sheets. In version 3.2, CSS were embedded in HTML page itself. Therefore,
      if the website has various web pages to apply to the style of each page,
      we must place CSS on each web page. Hence there was a repetition of the
      same block of CSS.
    </p>

    <h3>HTML5</h3>
    <p>
      is the new web standard. It follows HTML 4 (which came out way back in
      1997) and XHTML. Since the introduction of HTML4, a lot has happened with
      the web and something needed to be done to address all the new
      technologies and latest multimedia. HTML5 is the result of cooperation
      that began in 2006 between the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web
      Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG). While HTML5 is
      still evolving (still under development), the latest browsers do support
      many of the new features and elements in this version. The basic aim of
      HTML5 is to provide two things - (1) to improve the language and (2) to
      support the latest multimedia. In order to accomplish this, some ground
      rules were established by the W3C and WHATWG. Among them were to reduce
      the need for external plug-ins (such as Flash plug-ins), better handling
      of errors, and more markup elements (tags) to replace scripting. HTML5
      should also be device independent (that is, understood by computers and
      the many devices in existence today) while also keeping it easily readable
      by us humans. /p>
