    <h3>HTML 5</h3>
    <p>
      Current code: The following will be the first line in the index.html or
      about.htm:

      <!DOCTYPE html>

      </li>
      <li>
        An editing API in combination with a new global contenteditable
        attribute.
      </li>

        An API that exposes the history and allows pages to add to it to prevent
        breaking the back button.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>HTML 4.01</h3>
    <p>
      Older code: The following will be the first line in the index.html or
      about.htm: HTML4 has been a standard web development for more than 10
      years. HTML4 is approved and ratified as a standard language for browsers
      by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), an organization which specifies
      and approves standards for web technologies. However, with the advent of
      smart-phones era, things have totally changed and that change has effected
      or rather revolutionized the way websites are developed. Now apart from
      targeting desktop PCs and laptops, web-developers have to keep in mind
      that their website would be accessed by mobile-user; and with the growing
      number of mobile users, this concern is growing proportionally. Though,
      HTML4 is still a W3C standard for browser applications, it doesnâ€™t fully
      cater to the changing trends of the computing industry. Therefore, HTML5
      has been developed with intent to cop-up with these new challenges in web
      industry. HTML5 is more flexible, robust and advanced as compare to its
      older counterpart.

    <h3>HTML 3.2</h3>
    <p>
      HTML 3.2 is W3C's specification for HTML, developed in early `96 together
      with vendors including IBM, Microsoft, Netscape Communications
      Corporation, Novell, SoftQuad, Spyglass, and Sun Microsystems. HTML 3.2
      adds widely deployed features such as tables, applets and text flow around
      images, while providing full backwards compatibility with the existing
      standard HTML 2.0. W3C is continuing to work with vendors on extensions
      for accessibility features, multimedia objects, scripting, style sheets,
      layout, forms, math and internationalization. W3C plans on incorporating
      this work in further versions of HTML.

      and it is hard to find any differences in coding in www.
